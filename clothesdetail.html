    <p>I’ve engineered this shirt to be the foundation of your daily uniform. I didn’t just make a "cheap" tee; I built a high-performance essential that defies its $10 price tag.
Here is exactly how I built it for you:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>I sourced 100% Ring-Spun Cotton: Unlike the rough "carded" cotton in most budget shirts, my fibers are twisted and thinned. It’s noticeably softer and stronger.</li>
    <li>I chose a 160 GSM weight: It’s my "Goldilocks" weight—thick enough to feel premium and avoid transparency, but light enough to breathe when you're layering.</li>
    <li>I optimized the Dye Process: I use reactive dyes that bond to the fiber. My blacks stay deep and my whites stay crisp, even after 20+ cycles in the machine.</li>

</ul>

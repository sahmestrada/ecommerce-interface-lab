The Nike LeBron 20 is a low-top performance basketball shoe designed for speed and responsiveness, featuring a breathable engineered knit upper, dual-layered Swooshes, and a lightweight Cushion foam midsole.
It includes top-loaded Zoom Air in the forefoot, heel Zoom Air, and a carbon fiber shank for stability, designed for both court durability and a modern aesthetic.

            I use high-quality, ring-spun cotton so it feels incredibly soft against your skin from day one.

            I’ve reinforced the neckline with a high-tension rib to ensure it never loses its shape or "bacon" on you

            I tailored the cut to be modern and flattering, fitting perfectly through the chest and arms.

            I chose a versatile 160 GSM weight that provides enough coverage without feeling heavy or bulky.

            I stand by the durability, using double-needle stitching so it survives your weekly laundry cycle with ease.

            I keep the price at $10 by cutting out the middleman and focusing entirely on the quality of the fabric.
